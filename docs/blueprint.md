- Accent color: Muted Gold (#B8860B), used sparingly for interactive elements to provide a touch of luxury without overwhelming the interface.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' for a clean, modern, readable interface.
- Use clear, minimalist icons to represent each light bulb and scene. Ensure active states are easily distinguishable.
- A clean, grid-based layout to easily manage and control multiple lights and scenes.
